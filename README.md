- What principles did you apply?
    - KISS
    - DRY 
    - React Hooks
- An explanation of decisions taken and their motivation?
    - I decided to use React Hooks rather than Components as I felt working with functions to be cleaner
- Motivation for tool selection?
    - I chose to work with React as I am a lot more comfortable with this tool and have had greater experience with it
    - However given a bit more time I am confident I could pick up Vue and implement this 
- If time is limited what you would have done given more time?
    - Implemented a FindProductById() function that woukd take the product ID as the parameter (from the data of what is in the user's cart) and used that to pull the item picture and title to display this on the webpage 
    - Implementing updates to the user profile 
    - Rather than keeping everything in Home.js, creating seperate files to make the code cleaner 
    - Fixing the aesthetics and UI of the site 
    - Implementing routing to make the site look cleaner 
    - Deployment to Heroku 
    - Made a search bar to find products
    - Sorting by price feature when viewing products
